# k7n
A bash tool to setup [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) and [n2n](https://github.com/ntop/n2n) ([Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) behind a VPN) automatically. The name *k7n* results of the original two technologies concatenated (k3sn2n) and summed up in k8s manor.

## Motivation
Creating a working [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster can be a big challenge for beginners. It is way harder though, to create a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster behind a VPN, so also your nodes behind asymmetrical NAT can participate in your cluster (like my old laptop). This project aims to setup a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster behind a VPN automatically for you using [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) and [n2n](https://github.com/ntop/n2n). Adding a VPN to your infrastructure also provides security like explained [here](https://www.intruder.io/blog/how-to-secure-the-kubernetes-api-behind-a-vpn).

## Features
By just providing the IP's of your servers k7n will ssh into each of them and perform the full installation of the mentioned tools. At the moment a maximum of 255 servers can participate in a cluster.

### Supported Distributions
Supported Distributions of your *servers* *not* the *device you are executing the script* on. The script can run on almost any machine.
Icon | Distribution  | Status        |

## Installation
*Clone* the repository:  

```shell
git clone git@github.com:JakWai01/k7n.git
```  

Change your current directory to the k7n repository e.g.:  

```shell
cd ~/Documents/repos/k7n
```

## Usage
For example, to setup a cluster on 2 servers use the script like this:

```shell
bash ./k7n.sh $IP_ADDRESS_1 $IPADDRESS_2
```  

The first IP entered will be the supernode (This IP should be reachable from all hosts as it is the 'manager' of your VPN) as well as a normal node. All subsequent entered IP's will be additional nodes in your Cluster.  
In this case `$IP_ADDRESS_1` would be the supernode as well as a normal node and `$IPADDRESS_2` would just be another node.
You can add as many node IP's as you want to the command. The first IP (`$IPADDRESS_1`) will be the manager of your cluster.
All subsequent IP's are additional workers.
